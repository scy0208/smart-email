For further questions or comments about your privacy rights, please email us at support@springsun-tech.com.


## 11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES

### In Short:
We currently do not respond to Do-Not-Track ("DNT") signals, as there is no standardized interpretation or practice for such signals.

---

Most web browsers, as well as some mobile operating systems and applications, include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference regarding the collection and sharing of data about your online activities. However, there is currently no uniform technology standard or legal obligation for recognizing and implementing DNT signals. Therefore, we do not currently respond to DNT signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates a preference for online tracking.

Should a universally recognized or legally-mandated standard for DNT become finalized in the future, we will update our practices to comply with such a standard and will inform users of these changes through a revised version of this privacy notice.
